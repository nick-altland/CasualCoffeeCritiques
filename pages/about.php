                        <h3>What is Casual Café Critiques?</h3>
                        <p>Casual Café Critiques is a blog about my visits to the many different coffee shops in Burlington, Vermont, and my experiences at each. Check out the menu above to see the locations I have already visited and talked about.</p>

                        <h3>Who are you?</h3>
                        <p>My name is Nick. I am a 24 year old college drop out who had to move back in with my parents three years ago after a brief stint of homelessness. After finally getting my life back together, I am giving school a second shot this fall as a computer science major at UVM.</p>

                        <h3>What qualifies you to review coffee shops?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely nothing except I like coffee and have access to internet. Do not expect these reviews to be objective at all or even slightly professional. </p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="fourth">
                        <h3>Why are you reviewing coffee café’s then?</h3>
                        <p>While this blog WILL delve into my experiences at each location, above all this venture is a way for me to have fun exploring my new city and practice some creative writing while doing it. Blogging about it just happened to be a good way to organize my thoughts and seemed fun.</p>

                    <section class="fifth">
                        <h3>What about the reviews then?</h3>
                        <p>They will be structured in whatever style I am in the mood for. This blog is meant to be informational and informative to someone curious about the “best” coffee shop in the city, but I do want to try a variety of styles. I have not written any poetry since high school, and for some reason it was the first thing that popped into my mind as something to try. I can say with certainty that one thing each piece will include is some sort of chart rating the coffee, atmosphere, and location of each café on a scale of 1-5. I’m not very good at Photoshop, but we’ll see what I can cobble together. </p>

                        <h3>How often will this be updated?</h3>
                        <p>Not a clue, definitely not regularly. I currently work two jobs, 50-65 hours a week, so I have not as much time as I would like to visit the café’s as I would like. That is the biggest obstacle at the moment, as well as the writing itself. But we’ll see. </p>

                    <section class="seventh">
                        <h3>Will you visit all of the shops in Burlington?</h3>
                        <p>That’s the goal!</p>

                    <section class="eighth">
                        <h3>What is your drink of choice?</h3>
                        <p>For ages it was an Americano, cause it’s just espresso and water, but recently I have gotten a taste for drinks with more flavor. Each café usually has some sort of fun, unique latte or espresso exclusive to that location, so I have been ordering those. It seems like a good way to expand my pallet and get an idea of that location’s “flavor”. So far, it’s gone fairly well.</p>

                    <section class="ninth">
                        <h3>What do you do besides drink coffee and work?</h3>
                        <p>Not much really. Exercise when I can and play a variety of video games, although my new apartment’s internet sucks too much to play any online shooters so I have been focusing on single player games. I recently started Nier Automata and it is pretty fantastic. That’s about it.</p>

                        <p>Well, that’s all I have time for at the moment. My coffee cup is empty and I have to put on pants for work. Hope this little Q/A was helpful and informative, and that your day, reader, is a happy one. May your lattes be steamy, your cappuccinos frothy, and your espressos stronger the Colombian cocaine.</p>
