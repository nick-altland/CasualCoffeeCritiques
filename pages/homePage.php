                    <p>That has been my go to coffee for the past few years whenever I stopped at a Starbucks or Dunkin. Simple, hard to screw up, and get’s the job done. But stopping for coffee instead of making some at home is a rare occasion for me. If I pause for a moment and think about it, I can count those occasions from this past year on one hand. I do drink coffee, most days and some nights in fact. I just make it at home in a Keurig. Granted, although I grind the beans fresh every day and use reusable pods, it still is not very good. It is quick, easy, and cheap, all of which is vital when you are waking up for a 6am factory job five or six days a week. Turn on the machine, take a shower, throw the coffee in, put on pants, hope your socks match, grab the cup, add some almond creamer, and you are out the door in less then twenty minutes. Too bad you forgot your lunch. Maybe another cup at work instead. </p>

                    <p>This has all changed for me. Recently, I quit my job and moved to Burlington, Vermont to go to school. Now I have time to stop and enjoy my mornings and my coffee. There is just one problem, and it began before I even finished moving in. As I was carrying my last box up all three flights of stairs to my loft apartment, I realized that I had left my coffee maker at home. It was just past noon, my legs hurt, I was tired, and all that was left from my morning cup was the dregs at the bottom. Unacceptable. So, using what little energy I had left, I punched in “Coffee near me” into google and watched in delight as the entire map lit up with dozens of shops. Turns out, I moved into coffee café paradise without even realizing it. The day was saved. </p>

                    <p>While walking to the nearest shop, as a bit of a joke I took a screenshot and shared it with some friends. While everyone politely nodded their heads, said “Why yes Nick, you are right, that is a lot of coffee shops”, then went back to their day, I was still looking at the map. Scrolling through a bit more, I found even more cafés around that did not pop up. There were just too many for Google to show on the map view. Arriving at my destination, a tiny little corner shop called “Perky Planet Coffee”. I ordered my iced Americano, gave the nice man behind the bar his 3$, then went outside to relax and enjoy my drink. Sitting there, sipping my quite honestly mediocre coffee, I was still looking through all the other locations on the map. An idea was stirring. What if I visited every single café on that map and found out which one I liked the best. It would be a good way to explore my new hometown, and besides, I like coffee. It would be fun! So I went home and made a list of over 30 locations within reasonable distance of my apartment. </p>

                    <p>While going through the list, I had another idea. Not only would I visit every single one of these shops, but I would keep track of each one. Hell, why not have fun with it and write little reviews so I knew which had the best coffee, what one would be good to just relax and work at, and which had the best of both. Blogging it was just a natural evolution of this idea. Thus, “Casual Café Critiques” was born. <strong>Casual</strong> because I am, after all, a rather casual and inexperienced coffee drinker. I have never ground my coffee by hand, I do not own an expresso machine (although I did briefly own a stovetop Moka pot), and I drank my coffee black for years just because it was easier. <strong>Café</strong> because… well that one is obvious, isn’t it? Lastly, <strong>Critiques</strong> because I like alliteration and CCC has better branding opportunities. Besides, if I went for R for Reviews, well CCR is already a bit of a household name</p>

                    <p>Finally. With all this out of the way, what will this blog actually be? Quite simply, it will be a review of the various coffee shops I plan on visiting. I have visited just two shops so far, Perky Planet Coffee and Kestrel Coffee Roasters (just noticed it’s a play on kestrel and roost, a place where birds sleep, well done), and those reviews should be up shortly. However, I am not quite sure what shape those reviews will be in. Yes, short factual and informative is well and good, but is it fun? What about reviews in the form of poetry? Fun yes, informative? We’ll find out. It has been years since I had any reason to write creatively, so I am interested how this goes. There are a few different directions I could take this, and I hope you are as excited as I am to see the end result. </p>
