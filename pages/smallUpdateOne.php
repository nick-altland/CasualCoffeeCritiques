                        <p>So. There should be a new coffee shop review tomorrow. Two reasons why it’s been so long. First is that I have been working an insane amount of hours so that I wanna just melt into my bed when I get home, but honestly the biggest reason is… I keep going to new shops to write and get sidetracked with the new one.</p>

                        <p>SO. I currently have two reviews almost finished and a third one with the scaffolding up. Expect one of those tomorrow and the second one Thursday. There. Boom. A deadline I have to work towards. Have a good Monday.</p>
